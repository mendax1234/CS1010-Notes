# Lab 08 - C Preprocessor

## Exercise 5

1. [#char-cs1010\_read\_line\_arraysize\_t-k](../../past-year-exam/pe1-review/#char-cs1010\_read\_line\_arraysize\_t-k "mention") will include the `\n` character.

## C Preprocessing

1. Use `#define` to define a constant to make your program more readable.
2. Macros - Generic Type. `T` means type, can be any type

## Bonus Info

1. There are five major types of operations which are core to algorithm optimization: **insertion, removal, retrieval, searching** and **sorting**.

## Searching and Sorting

### Binary Search

1. Probably the **most powerful** search algorithm for simple arrays.
2. The idea of **search space.**
3. **Sorted** means non-descending in CS.

### Comparison-Based Sort

The idea is the pair-wised comparison is important.

#### Bubble Sort

1. There are some better cases when the time complexity is $$O(N)$$.

#### Insertion Sort

1. When the array is sorted, the time complexity is $$O(N)$$

#### Selection Sort

1. The time complexity is always $$O(N)$$

### Counting Sort

1. To use it on negative indices, use the idea of mapping. For example, -9 to 0.

## Exercise 6

1. Start from the minimum point, have two directions.
2. Every time see $$log(n)$$, try thinking about binary search.
3. Every time see $$O(N)$$, which means can done in one iteration.
