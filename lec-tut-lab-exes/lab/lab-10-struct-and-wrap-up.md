## Exercise 8

## Preamble to OOP: struct

## Moving Forward from CS1010...

1. Learn other programming languages: C++ (CS2040C), Java (CS2113(T), CS2030(S)), Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, C#.
2. Learn about other programming paradigms. (Currently in CS1010, we practice breaking big problems into small problems and then solve it).
3. Learn about software engineering principles and design patterns (CS2113(T))
4. Do your own projects! (Orbital, CVWO)

### What to expect from CS2040C

* Fundamentals of C++ and OOP
* Data structures, their implementations and applications

### Introduction to Different Programming Paradigms

A "programming paradigm" is  a framework for solving computational problems. e.g. we move from procedure thinking (what we have learned in CS1010) to the object oriented programming thinking.

(Which course will teach Functional Programming?)
