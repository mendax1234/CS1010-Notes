### 4. Marks

Construct a **cumulative frequency** table.

## Recursion & Backtracking

It seems (erroneously) that recursion is always about "going backwards". but it is not always the case.

A problem-solving paradigm (Usually used in AI):

* Suppose we have an **initial state** S.
* Our **goal** is to find all states where a **terminating condition** p holds.
* Upon entering each **current state X**, we first check if p is true. If it is, we **collect X** as a valid result.
* Else, we explore the **actions** that can be performed at state X to **transition** to a different state Y.
* For each new state Y generated this way, we enter it and repeat the process.
* After **exhausting** all possible actions, we **return** to the previous state.

And the steps can be summarized as:

1. Define goal(S)
2. Define condition for goal(S)
3. Define state representation
4. Define actions and transitions (Usually it is recursion)
5. Invoke function with initial state

Backtracking is **searching by brute force.**

{% hint style="info" %}
The difficult part is for us to find "initial state S, goal, terminating condition, actions that can be performed to transition, return to the previous state".
{% endhint %}

We can practice this kind of thinking using one of the past year PE questions [#id-5.-stone](../../past-year-exam/midterm-pe/pe1-ay21-22.md#id-5.-stone "mention").

1. We start our sequence $$s=\empty$$ and number of digits k = 0
2. At every stage, check: is k = n? (This is our terminating condition)
   1. If yes, then this is a valid sequence, we will print it and return (**Collect** a valid result and **backtrack** to the previous state)
   2. If no, then we have 2 choices to proceed to the next stage:
      1. Append 0 to the end of `s`; or
      2. Append 1 to the end of `s`

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```c
void print_binary(long k, long n) {
    // Is [s, k] a goal state?
    if (k == n) {
        // Yes, collect the result.
        cs1010_println_string("");
        // Backtrack to the previous state.
        return;
    }
    // No, explore the possible actions.
    // Action 1: append 0.
    // Transition 1: [s, k] -> [s0, k + 1].
    putchar('0');
    print_binary(k + 1, n);
    // Action 2: append 1.
    // Transition 2: [s, k] -> [s1, k + 1].
    putchar('1');
    print_binary(k + 1, n);
}
int main() {
    long n = cs1010_read_long();
    print_binary(0, n); // Initial state: ["", 0].
    return 0;
}
```
{% endcode %}

However, this code will miss printing the digits infront in the after backtracking. There are two methods to solve this:

1. Change the representation to whole number. See [#id-5.-stone](../../past-year-exam/midterm-pe/pe1-ay21-22.md#id-5.-stone "mention")
2. Use an array to store the appended characters. See [#id-3.-group](../../past-year-exam/pe2-review/pe2-ay22-23.md#id-3.-group "mention")

### Graph Traversal

Taking the Depth-First-Search as an example. Given that two vertices v and u, we wish to determine whether they are connected by a path.

Identify the following

1. **Current Stage:** The current vertex x (initially v)
2. **Terminating Condition**: x=u
3. **State Transitions**: Move to any unvisited neighbour of x

## Exercise 7

### 3. walk

A genius way to solve this problem is to use combinatorics! Legit genius! But only implementing $$nCr$$ directly is not correct! (The factorial will easily exceed the space limit of `long`). Try the step-by-step solution.
