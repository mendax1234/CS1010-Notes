# Lab 04

## Testing

### Some conventions

1. It is **impossible** to enumerate all test cases.
2. It is **possible** to divide the test cases into a few groups.
3. We can choose to test for all possible **classes of inputs/outputs.**

## Exercise 2 Review

### factor.c

Optimization methods:

1. $$n-1\rightarrow  \frac{n}{2}$$ since anything bigger than $$\frac{n}{2}$$ for sure cannot divide n!

### collatz.c

{% hint style="info" %}
**When to use `for` or `while`?**

**\`for\` is used under the circumstances where we iterate through consecutive numbers. \`while\` loops are used under the circumstances that we don't iterate through consecutive numbers.**
{% endhint %}

### pattern.c
