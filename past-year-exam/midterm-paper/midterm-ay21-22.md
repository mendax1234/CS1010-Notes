## Problems

### 4. Data Type Conversion

There is only one point to note down in this problem, that is **when you assign a** `double` **to a** `long` **,the numbers after the floating point will be trauncated.**

For example,

```c
long x = 2.00 - 1.00; // x will be 1
```

### 7. Assertion

One tip is that when doing questions about **assertion or loop variant**, check all the options since there are likely to have some **trivial one**!!!

### 8. Logical Expression\*

A good question that tests your **Truth Table Method**, good to try again!

### 12. Recursion\*

Another awesome question worth trying again to test the recursion thinking.
