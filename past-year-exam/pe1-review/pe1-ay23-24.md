## Problems

### 2. Nigh

This question reminds us the importance of counting the **frequency** of each digit in a number, which appears in [Ex3 Q4](https://nus-cs1010.github.io/2425-s1/exercises/ex03.html#question-4-largest) before.

### 3. Alternate

This question teaches us an important point: when traversing from end to the start of a string, it is always recommended to **cast the loop index to be `long`!** Since `size_t` will always be 0 and we still need to zero index element, so it will be hard for us to define when to stop!

### 4. Grammar

> This is actually a [#sliding-window](./#sliding-window "mention") problem.

But I use a recursive method when doing this question at the first time

```c
bool grammar_check(size_t start, size_t end, char *word)
{
  if (start == end)
  {
    return step_3(word[start]);
  }
  if (word[start] == '%' && word[end] == '#')
  {
    return grammar_check(start + 1, end - 1, word);
  }
  if (word[start] == '@' && word[start + 1] == '@')
  {
    return grammar_check(start + 2, end, word);
  }
  return false;
}
```

### 5. Pirate

> This problem is similar to [Ex5 Q6](https://nus-cs1010.github.io/2425-s1/exercises/ex05.html#question-6-social)

1. For Captains, we notice that the **captains** are all in the diagonal of the 2-D matrix whose value is **not -1** (Suppose I initialise all the elements to -1)
2. For counting crew numbers, we use the recursive thinking, start from the captain, once we find a crew, treat the crew as a new "captain" and find its crew. Until we have iterated every row in each function call. We are done
